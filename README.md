# Sidebery

Tweaks to support Sidebery as an alternative to Zen's native tabs and workspace implementation.

### Features
- Hide Native Zen Tab UI
  > Hides the default Zen Tab bar, so you can use Sidebery as a drop-in replacement for the native tab manager.
- Collapsed Mode
  > Collapses Sidebery to a narrower sidebar, configurable to auto-expand on hover.
- Auto-hide Sideberry
  > Auto-hide Sidebery, when not hovering over it. Configurable to only hide in fullscreen mode, compact mode, or both.
- Move sidebar header to the bottom
- Or hide the sidebar header altogetherfor a cleaner look
- Transparent background
  > Turns the sidebar background transparent, so it blends right in with your Zen theme.

### Dependencies:
- **[Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery)** 
- (or optionally **[Sidebery (Zen)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery-zen/)** for some extra tweaks modified for Zen support.)

### Operation Tips
- You must download, install and activate Sidebery on your own.
- To bring Sidebery in view or to hide again, press F1 anytime.
- Some changes, in rare cases, require you toggle Sidebery visibility or restart the browser.
- Rememeber to clear your userChrome.css entries and Sidebery style customizations if things appear broken. 
- If you manage to shrink the sidebar too much while playing with settings, you can always drag it back to original size.
- Feel free to report issues and feature requests.
